I use my own function `make_scene` to build the scenes, it won't work for you. If you try to build a scene, you will get an import error. You either need to remove the import and the code in if-main and build the scene the standard way or get the `make_scene.py` file (here)[https://github.com/tomasderner97/customutils2/blob/master/manimutils/make_scene.py] and edit the import line to point at it.
